						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Hi, I'm Manny! I'm an entry to junior level full stack developer, graduated from Stockton University with a bachelor's degree in computer science. In my time at Stockton I've had extensive experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Java, and SQL.</p>
					<br>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Additionally, I worked in the Esports program at Stockton, both as a player and a teams manager. I've also worked in the Eastern College Athletic Conference(ECAC) in their Esports division as a league organizer.</p>
					<br>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   As an individual who is passionate in both computer science and Esports, I am confident that my diverse skillset makes me a unique and valuable candidate for a variety of roles.</p>
